<aside>
    <p>Jessica has been creative her whole life. This page shows just some of the paintings she has made. Her artwork has a focus that is queer and female energy based. A lot of her artwork is abstract and colorful. Some of Jessica's other hobbies include writing poems, paranormal romance stories, and music. She should also join a scrabble tournament because she is great at playing it. As of yet however, she has not competed. Jessica also creates different products like jewelry, natural products (skincare, bath salts, aromatherapy, and candles). She also occasionally sews and has created things like quilt purses since she was in high school. Jessica claims that she needs creative outlets in her life. I have had the pleasure of knowing her for a year and a half and she puts creativity into everything she does. Occasionally, she will even make simple syrups from scratch or cook amazing vegan versions of foods she loves and everything tastes amazing.</p>
