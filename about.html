She likes various genres, and her playlists will take you anywhere from Classical music to Punk and R&B. She tries to go to concerts whenever she can. If you ever go on a car ride with her, she will always have music playing in the background or even simply around the house while sheâ€™s cleaning or doing other things. She is a great mother of two human kids and two fur babies. Her furry family includes Bruce, a cat and Cosmo, a big German Shepherd. They co-exist peacefully with one another.

Getting out of her comfort zone is something she does whenever she can. She loves karaoke and will occasionally go and sing at local events around town. Jessica has been vegan for nine years. She is a great cook and will find vegan substitutes for her favorite dishes while making everything from scratch. Some of her favorite dishes are nachos and tacos.
